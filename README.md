# My First Python Projects

This repository contains beginner-level Python projects I created while learning programming.

## Projects

- **calculator.py** – a basic text calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
- **menu_app.py** – a simple text-based menu that lets the user choose different options

I'm learning Python step by step and documenting my progress here.
